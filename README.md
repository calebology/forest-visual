# Preface

Forest is an application that is based on the Pomodoro technique that tracks "focused hours" from durations ranging from 10 minutes to 2 hours. It allows custom tagging and exports to CSV. This project serves as practise for basic data wrangling and descriptive statistics. The data set that is presented spans from May 2019 to May 2020.

After a full academic year of using Forest for every study session, here are the goals and insights I want to glean from the data.



## Main Questions

- Find out what timings during which I am the most productive
- Visualize trends in focused time over the span of available data
    - Frequency distribution / histogram ??
- Find the relative payoffs for the time invested vs the grades received for each module 
    - Find an estimate for the amount of time invested to move through each letter grade
    
    
## Key Assumptions
- For this study, focused time is assumed to be a representation of productivity, while controlling for proper tags
